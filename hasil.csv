"0,Kota Lama Semarang,Gede Bagus Bayu Pentium,5.0,""It is a rising popular place in Semarang for both locals and tourists. The concept is the renewal of old building complexes from the colonial period. It has a lot of old buildings with colonial architecture. And then it's mixed with a lot of cafes, restaurants, photo spots, and places to chill. Unfortunately we went there during the day, it was quite hot and a lot of cars were going around. Our friend said during the night it would have a lot of light and very pretty. Especially on Saturday night it will have a car free night, so you can roam the area easily. I can imagine the place will be very nice if well lit during the night. Will try again to visit next time during night time."""
